        "TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers. It regulates cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and genomic stability. Mutations in TP53 are often associated with poor prognosis, therapy resistance, and aggressive tumor behavior. By focusing on TP53 in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), this pipeline aims to detect actionable mutations and monitor clonal dynamics across treatment."

        "In this analysis, we processed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) sequencing data from a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer to investigate variants in the TP53 gene pre- and post-treatment with first-line chemotherapy and anti-EGFR therapy. Raw FASTQ reads were downloaded from the NCBI SRA database and subjected to quality control using FastQC and MultiQC to ensure high-quality sequencing data. Reads were then aligned to the targeted TP53 region of the human reference genome (hg19) using BWA, followed by sorting and indexing with Samtools. Variants were identified with Bcftools, and low-confidence calls were filtered to retain high-quality variants with sufficient read depth. This workflow enables the detection and comparison of TP53 mutations before and after treatment, providing insights into tumor evolution and potential mechanisms of therapy response, while also producing visual and tabular summaries suitable for interpretation, presentation, and clinical relevance assessment."

        "**Why were specific tools for the analysis:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The tools selected for this TP53 variant calling pipeline were chosen for their efficiency, compatibility with Google Colab, and relevance to the task of targeted DNA variant analysis. SRA Toolkit’s fasterq-dump was used to retrieve raw sequencing data directly from NCBI, offering parallelization and streamlined file handling. FastQC and MultiQC provided essential quality control, allowing for rapid assessment of read integrity and adapter contamination. BWA MEM was selected for alignment due to its speed and accuracy with short reads, especially in targeted regions like TP53. Samtools was used for sorting, indexing, and manipulating BAM files, while BCFtools handled variant calling and filtering with minimal overhead. These tools are lightweight, scriptable, and widely adopted in clinical genomics workflows. Heavier alternatives like GATK were intentionally avoided due to their complexity and resource demands, which are unnecessary for single-gene analysis in a cloud-based notebook. Similarly, RNA-seq aligners like STAR or HISAT2, and automation frameworks like Snakemake or Nextflow, were excluded to maintain simplicity and focus. By using Miniconda and Bioconda, the environment remained reproducible and stable, avoiding dependency conflicts common in Colab. Overall, this toolset reflects a resource-conscious, streamlined approach tailored to ctDNA analysis of TP53.\n"

Two timepoints were analyzed: SRR13973710 (pre-treatment) and SRR13973711 (post-treatment). These samples represent paired plasma-derived ctDNA collected before and after therapeutic intervention, allowing for longitudinal tracking of tumor-associated mutations. The focus on TP53, a key tumor suppressor gene, enables detection of clinically relevant variants that may reflect treatment response, clonal evolution, or residual disease. This patient was chosen to illustrate how targeted variant calling in ctDNA can reveal actionable insights and support precision oncology.\n"

        "I encountered persistent errors running FastQC in Google Colab because its default installation method (via .zip) relies on a Java-based GUI and classpath structure that doesn't work reliably in Colab’s virtual environment. To resolve this, I installed Miniconda — a lightweight version of Anaconda — which allows to use the Bioconda channel to install bioinformatics tools like FastQC in a more stable and reproducible way. Miniconda sets up an isolated environment with proper dependencies, avoiding the broken classpath issues. However, because Colab is non-interactive, Conda requires explicit acceptance of its Terms of Service for certain channels before proceeding. Once those were accepted, I could install FastQC cleanly and run it without the Java class errors. This approach ensures compatibility, avoids manual setup pitfalls, and aligns with best practices for reproducible bioinformatics workflows in cloud-based notebooks.\n"

        "The alignment statistics from both pre-treatment and post-treatment samples indicate high-quality sequencing data and consistent performance across the pipeline. The pre-treatment sample contained approximately 9.5 million total reads, with 1.69 million (17.73%) successfully mapped to the TP53 locus. Similarly, the post-treatment sample had 11.6 million reads, with 1.98 million (17.08%) mapped. These mapping rates are expected given that the alignment was restricted to a small genomic region (TP53), meaning most reads from whole-genome or exome libraries would not align. Both samples showed a high proportion of properly paired reads—14.98% for pre-treatment and 14.56% for post-treatment—indicating good fragment integrity. Singleton rates were low in both cases (under 1%), suggesting minimal fragmentation or library preparation issues. Notably, no duplicates were reported, which may indicate either that deduplication was not performed or that the data had inherently low redundancy—an important consideration in ctDNA analysis where input material is limited. Overall, the alignment metrics confirm that the sequencing data is of high quality and suitable for downstream variant calling and interpretation."

        "Filtered VCF files generated by BCFtools serve as a refined list of high-confidence variants, making them ideal for downstream interpretation. To utilize these files effectively, one should begin by parsing key fields such as chromosome, position, reference and alternate alleles, quality scores (QUAL), read depth (DP), and variant-specific metrics like allele frequency (VAF), which can be calculated from the DP4 field. Converting relative positions to genomic coordinates allows for accurate mapping to known loci. These variants can then be annotated using public databases like ClinVar or COSMIC to identify clinically relevant mutations, particularly in genes like TP53 where hotspot mutations (e.g., R175H, R248Q, R273C) are well-characterized. Comparing variant profiles across timepoints (e.g., pre- vs post-treatment) enables tracking of clonal dynamics, emergence of resistance mutations, or clearance of tumor-associated variants. Ultimately, filtered VCFs provide a focused dataset that, when combined with annotation and contextual analysis, can yield insights into disease progression, therapeutic response, and potential clinical actionability."

A central component would be a mutation summary dashboard—either as a clean table or infographic—highlighting key variants with their genomic positions, allele frequencies, quality scores, and clinical annotations such as protein changes and ClinVar status. To illustrate tumor evolution, I would include bar plots comparing variant allele frequencies (VAFs) between pre- and post-treatment samples, emphasizing emerging or disappearing mutations. A TP53 lollipop plot would map mutations along the protein structure, spotlighting known hotspots and their functional domains. For longitudinal studies, a timeline graphic could show how specific mutations evolve over time, offering insights into clonal dynamics and treatment response. These visuals would be integrated into a slide deck or interactive dashboard, combining scientific rigor with accessible storytelling. This approach would not only support data-driven insights but also enhance communication with collaborators, clinicians, and potential stakeholders in translational research or precision oncology."
